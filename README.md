# wxpython-actions

Test github actions and python 

options to pyinstaller
- `-F` is to create one file
- `--windowed` is to create a real mac bundle
- `--noconfirm` is to say yes to delete the existing files
- `-i FILE.icns`  specify an icon
- 
    pyinstaller --windowed -F --noconfirm rubber_band_async.py

## Mac

Without `--windowed`, you won't get an app bundle you can run. It will complain about needing a framework build of Python.  

> You *can* have a venv pointing to a `pyenv` Python framework install, and build a proper wxpython exe. ðŸŽ‰  viz. `Pyinstaller` running out of the venv will build it just fine.  Proof is https://github.com/abulka/wxpython-actions/actions/runs/997316399
